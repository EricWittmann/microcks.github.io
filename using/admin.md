			<p>
			As stated by the name, this feature allows you to simply export to a JSON file a part or a whole Microcks repository. By repository we mean, all your micro-services definitions, their operations and request / response samples. Import jobs or tests are not exportable. Exporting and then re-importing repository allows you for example, to quickly set-up a new environment with potentially different response times settings (see below) for dedicated usage such as performance validation or user-acceptance tests.
